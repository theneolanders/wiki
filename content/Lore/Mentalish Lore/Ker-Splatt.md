When the universe was young, there were The Primordials. The base of all life, a simple ooze. However with them came a spark to evolve, and in the fashion of his species, Ker-splat gained his sentience after a few millennia of existence, to which he grew with curiosity. Observing the other life on his planet, he evolved to learn and even mimic them. Valuing their short existences, he memorized their DNA in the ooze of his essence, and vowed to continue to collect more knowledge and DNA so that none would ever be forgotten. As the centuries passed, he discovered more of his kind, and it seems he was not the only one with a thirst for collections of life. Together they formed the Collective. A vast library of knowledge of lifeforms spanning across the universe. Having cataloged so many planets, they turned to the stars for more. It was a fateful day that on one dying planet the Life Bringers came. An unusual encounter, but both sides realized they could help each other. The Collective could share the knowledge of life that once was to the Life Bringers who could bring them all back. A symbiotic relationship was formed. Both sides worked together, traveling from planet to planet, bringing extinct life back. For every Life Bringer there was a Primordial companion.

However, there was still danger. As the universe matured, so did its harsher life forms grow. Life Bringers were thought of as rare trophies and were often hunted. Ker-Splatts Life Bringer was chased and killed, stranding him on a dying planet. With no way to leave, Ker-Splatt remained there for millenia, cataloging the life to pass the time until either the planet cracked in two or another species with ships came through.

Luck would have him, as a young lost Life Bringer named Nimeeko passed by, sensing the planet's pain. There he chased her down and asked for help, a way to leave. Curious of him she accepted, perhaps she would not fly alone anymore. And they did. For the next few centuries they worked together in their duties to revitalize old planets with life. And they continued through until they met the Ringleaders one day.
