# Unusual Success

Samuel is born onto the planet Beynos in the year 2171, and from a young age he would notice many inconsistencies in the planet's educational system, and in-fact outgrew the system by the mere age of twelve through self taught research and learning.

By age twenty, he would uncover information about the [[Congregation of the Dead Earth]], and became a form of political figure for all such information to be outsourced to the public, and with such information eventually released, would begin Mantra Innovators and it's technological advancements.

##### Splinter Anomaly
At the age of twenty three, during his first trip on space travel, he would encounter a weak point in the universe's [[The Multiverse#Lower|lower membrane]], causing him to be affected with [[The Splinter Anomaly]], this would cause him to add onto his already immense intelligence and abilities to further progress his planet's technology.

##### End of Success
At the age of thirty three in the year 2201, he is extremely successful, nearly single handedly making up for multiple hundreds of years in technological developments, the only unfinished side project being the idea of projecting himself into some form of machine due to his degrading health due to [[E.N.E.R.G.I|ENERGI poisoning]]. This would be impossible as far as he could see due to a pure lack in resources and time.

Soon enough, Samuel would have his first contact with [[Memento]] visiting his planet in beynos.

A few more years later would be his death, but then his resurrection or much closer to reincarnation in form of [[Unit 19]].

# Personality

As Samuel aged, his positivity and optimism would dim, especially so in the last couple years of his life, but overall he stayed very similar to as he started out when he founded Mantra Innovators.

He is a very strong minded person, to him every single experience regardless of importance is ***somehow*** a learning experience to him, a failure to solve a problem is a simple setback before eventual success, something breaking is only a chance to build it up stronger and more efficient, there is always improvement and at the very least, the information of anything can simply intrigue him.

He doubts himself along every step of all processes in creation or day to day actions, not because he's scared or worried he's doing something wrong, but in the search to think that he could be doing something better, to him there's always something to improve upon in any field of research, or in oneself, it's simply a matter of crossing the barrier's of the mind.

# Physical Description

Samuel has fluffy and messy brown hair that he doesn't bother fixing, he used to have uniquely colored bright blue eyes, but is replaced with his blue metallic goggles that are his eyes, that of which display digital eyes for emoting visually.

Samuel generally makes an effort to keep a very consistent style of clothing, always keeping his lab coat on due to usually always working on something, a simple t-shirt with his company's logo right on the front which is two white hollowed circles overlapping in the middle typically accompanied with a black or gray background. He wears thick pants, mostly consisting of denim or leather.

He has artificial mechanical arms that change in quality throughout his life as he improves them, all of which consist of the blue and bronze metals typically used with his creations
