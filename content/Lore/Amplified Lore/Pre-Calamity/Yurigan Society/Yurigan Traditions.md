## Days of Artifice
During the height of the harsh winter on Zenitaf's northern hemisphere the early Yurigans would spend their time huddled in their houses, with little else to do, and an innate desire for creation driving them, many of them began to make small gifts for one another. A common belief among Yurigans was that Zenitaf and everything on it was forged by Yuris itself, which many worshipped as their diety, and it was believed that during this time of year Yuris would impart Yurigans with divine inspiration for their creations. This simple tradition slowly grew into one of the largest celebrations of the year, and eventually even spread to every corner of Yuris. While many Yurigans across the planet celebrated in different ways, the core of the celebration always was self-expression and giving to those you care about, at least it was, until profit motives and the fast pace of the modern world left Yurigans with less time to create for one another, and more ways to simply buy their way out of it, leading to a holiday more about buying and selling, than making and giving.
