The Yurigans were a race of aliens that lived on the planet [[Zenitaf]]. They look similar to humans, but with skin that comes in various shades of bluish-gray, hair that usually has a slight blue tint. Their blue-gray tinting comes from the cobalt in their soil and an evolutionary motivation to blend in with their environment.
