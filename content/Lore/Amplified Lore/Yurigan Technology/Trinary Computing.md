Unlike the binary computers primarily utilized by Earth in [[The Primary Timeline]], [[Yurigans|Yurigan]] computers utilized a base-3, also referred to as ternary or trinary, number system for data storage and processing. This is represented by positive, negative, and neutral signals. but mapped from 0 to 2. While in some ways more complicated, this method of computing has a higher ceiling for data density, and is more efficient for some floating point operations.
[[Memento]]'s systems are still primarily represented in Trinary, requiring remapping to interact with human computer systems.
