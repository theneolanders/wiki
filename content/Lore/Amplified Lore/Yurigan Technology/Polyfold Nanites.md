The Polyfold Project was a top secret nanotech project at [[Amplicorp]], intended to enable easy terraforming for the reshaping of [[Zenitaf]] and the reversal of environmental damage done to the planet by [[Yurigans]].

Their current design is not properly documented as they adapt and evolve too quickly to precisely map, but they were originally designed with the following core specifications.

## Features
### Electro-Magnetic Bond Weakening
The nanites can subtly weaken molecular bonds by reversing the charge holding them together. This is what gives them the ability to disassemble and reconstitute most matter.

### Mesh Data Storage
While each nanite can only hold a few bytes of data, a collective of nanites can hold a massive amount of data collectively, including redundancies in the case of data loss.

### Mesh Processing
The Nanites process data similar to brain cells. Using their individual connections and associations to interpret data.

### Interlocking capabilities
The nanites can create hard-links between one another to form strong structures.

### Ion Navigation Thrusters
For basic navigation individual nanites can utilize the same apparatus responsible for their molecular bond control to move themselves using ionic thrust. small clusters of nanites can move using just this even in a gravity well. But when forming a larger collective they generally need to create specialized structures for locomotion.
