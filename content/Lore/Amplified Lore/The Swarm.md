The Swarm, also known by their project name **[[Polyfold]]**, is a nanobot swarm created by a **[Gray Goo Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo)** on the alien planet **[[Zenitaf]]**. Referred to as **[[The Zenitaf Calamity]]** The Swarm was born from the collective memories and data of every biological and artificial being on the planet, because the nanites that constitute them were initially programmed to harvest the data of all objects consumed for research purposes.

The Swarm is generally benevolent, having the perspective of billions of sentient beings and in theory being able to understand a wide array of conflicting perspectives, but in practice, this can make them slightly distant from the true nuance of issues, usually seeing solutions that rely on everyone getting along, when that is a variable that should not be relied on.

The Swarm has sworn to ensure the safety of **[[The Primary Timeline]]**'s Earth, having discovered Earth shortly after **[[Andromeda Transfer Incident#The Rusty Exodus|The Rusty Exodus]]** and helped them rebuild from both the initial effects, and fulfilled their original purpose for their creation **[[Zenitaf]]**, helping terraform and cleanse the Earth of pollution and environmental damage.
