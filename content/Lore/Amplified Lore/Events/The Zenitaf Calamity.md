The Zenitaf Calamity was a [Gray Goo Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo) that led to the complete destruction of the planet [[Zenitaf]] and the extinction of the [[Yurigans]], as well as the creation of [[Memento]].

The event was caused during a demonstration of [[Amplicorp]]'s upcoming [[Polyfold Nanites]]  being showcased by [[Isaac Grant]]. Where the nanites suddenly began to deconstruct all nearby matter. Several attempts were made to contain the swarm with [[Hardlight]] and EMP tech. But the nanites were extremely resilient and persistent, eventually overtaking the planet regardless. A few wealthy individuals attempted to escape the planet through spaceships, but most were taken down by the swarm or failed to safely exit atmosphere in the rush.
