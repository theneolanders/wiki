Overspace is a filament that houses every possible [[The Multiverse#The Timelines|timeline]] within it. Paradoxically, it is defined as being a place where existence itself cannot occur. A universe is then defined as an exemption from this rule where existence *can* occur. Anything not contained by an [[The Multiverse#Universal Membranes|upper membrane]] counts as Overspace, though the term "outside" is slightly misleading when assigned to a concept beyond spacetime.
