The Ring is a space station built by [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot|Rustybot]] and [[Memento]] in the year 2199. It was built as a form of truce between the two after they individually conclude they cannot defeat each other. Cared for by [[The Ring Steward|The Steward]], The Ring boasts a wide variety of large scale military and industrial equipment. It acts as a no-man's-land orbiting a star directly between The Milky Way and Andromeda where all parties involved can diplomatically interact.

As [[The Ringleaders]] become more comfortable with each other, tensions lower and The Ring turns from a no-combat zone to a home. Thanks to additions like The Lawn and The Mall, it serves as a beacon of hospitality within the [[The Multiverse|multiverse]].

# Rooms

## The Archive
The Ringleaders are no strangers to powerful artifacts or dangerous trinkets. The Archive is a non-Euclidian section of the space station brought into being by the magic of [[Flint Keystone]]. Within, one can find a plethora of cursed objects and otherworldly doohickeys, safely catalogued and stored away.

## The Council Chamber
The Council Chamber is located within the reinforced glass dome placed at the top of The Ring. It contains a large roundtable surrounded by chairs that represent each member of The Ringleaders council. The table is equipped with an array of hologram projectors and sensors that create a dynamic volumetric interface to facilitate interaction with The Ring's computer systems and can be used to present visuals during meetings.

## The Reactor
The Reactor is a massive [[Rusty Manufacturing#Underspace Harvester Cores|Underspace Harvester Core]] customized for the station's infrastructure. It is located deep within the station and is under constant monitoring by [[The Ring Steward]] and [[Rustybot]] to ensure security and stability. This room also contains an auxiliary traditional fusion reactor as a fallback and method of jump-starting a lower-membrane puncture in the event of Underspace reactor failure.

## The Server Room
The server room contains the core processing of The Ring's computer systems as well as The Steward's consciousness core, which is designed to be jettisoned in the case of an emergency that threatens the safety of The Steward and his memory banks containing the majority of important classified Ringleaders shared data.

## The Lawn
At Memento's suggestion after a large section of storage space is made obsolete by the addition of The Archive, a renovation takes place to convert the leftover real estate into a habitation module.
