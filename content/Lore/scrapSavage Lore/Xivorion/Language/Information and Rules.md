## Information

The [[Xivorion]] communicate in a nameless language, it is very easy to implement into a variety of species' minds (Since most of the words used are for modifying generic words). It focuses on being data dense so having a vast vocabulary is necessary but gives very accurate descriptions. This also makes information transfer slower but the language has ways to indicate that a transmission is not fully detailed and can be drawn out if needed.

For the sake of humans reading these documents most will be translated to English (outside of raw transmissions or in-world texts), however in-world elements in control of the [[Xivorion]] that have type will usually use this language.

If you need to translate any texts please refer to the written [[Vocabulary]]
