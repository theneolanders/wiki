Xivorion (Ziv-O-Ryan) is a group of organisms that rapidly increase population by taking control of nearby and useful species, forcing them to end or become Xivorion. This allows Xivorion to extract resources from planets and asteroids the other organisms lived on while they eliminate the weak and add the strong and useful to their forces. The end goal of the group is to have total control over all life in the universe and make it sustainable by any means necessary.

In the process of taking over another species, they may alter their physical and mental properties to best suit the envisioned role of that species in the Xivorion hierarchy. This usually includes imprinting the [[Information and rules]] of their language so they can communicate easily with the new additions, especially if they are an addition to the [[Military]].
