Psionites (Sigh-O-Nights) are a species of living crystal that have the natural ability to control nearby gravitational fields. The Psionites are created in asteroids and are able to extrude living mass around the inner Psionite crystal to serve biological functions or protection.

Psionites are typically stripped of the ability to think freely before they develop sentience because they have very many computational applications.
