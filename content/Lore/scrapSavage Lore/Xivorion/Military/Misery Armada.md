Misery Armada (or "vorov rot not contor o xiv") is a branch of the [[Xivorion]] [[Military]] made of up living robots. They are the lowest rank in the military as they are mass produced and disposable, therefore these robots is usually the face given to the [[Xivorion]] by survivors as it they are usually the only part seen by the outside world.

Unknown to most outside the [[Xivorion]] these soldiers are not actually robots, they are closer to large mechs for [[Psionites]]. They always have a deployable shield and taser, but are also usually armed with external weapon.
