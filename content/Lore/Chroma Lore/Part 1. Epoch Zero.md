"A Line is a Dot that Went For a Walk" - *Paul Klee, Painter*

# ***The Dot*** 

***Immediately following the collapse of the universe "Chroyane".***

 Flashing through awareness, happening is non-linear, non-sequential. Moments are incoherent, incomprehensible in number, there is no anchor. Grasping at perception is like trying to see the top of a ten-thousand foot waterfall as it crashes over the eyes. All that exists is a concept of is and is not.

Focus... Focus... 
  
Vibrations... 
  
Focus... Light... 
  
Focus... Color...
  
Focus... temperature a generalization of vibration... 
  
Vibrations...
  
Falling... Falling... Falling... Weight... 
  
Heat... Vibrations.... Heat... Vibrations... Heat... 
  
Impact...
  
Stillness.
  
The creature is aware of light peaking above, solid beneath, the cold air now filling it's dissolving capsule. 
  
The creature forms a fear of the cold, a lack of foundational vibration, it represents a lack of "is".

Fear... this word means nothing to the creature, words do not exist, only sensory. A nerve reacting to stimuli. 


The creature has made impact.


# *The Blooming of the Original Flower*

***Within another universe...***

Millions of years pass in a primordial landscape contained within a young planet. Generations after generations of microbial life evolve in then out of the sea, one day producing terrestrial air breathing life. A single bud, preparing to announce a new beauty to this world, begins to split open. A seam of brilliant white starts to break across it's surface.

Before the first wind blows across this worlds first petals, a darkness spreads across the organisms surface. In a flash of black, it vanishes.

This reality will not know this form of beauty. 


  
***The Primary Timeline...*** 

Near the crater from which the creature emerged, a flash of black. In it's place, a black flower blooms in bright glowing crimson. 

What was not to this planet now "is".


# ***Into the Woods***


***Nearly a Year Later on the Primary Timeline***

 Sixty years out from initial observations, an alien terraforming mission comes out of hypersleep and detects that the planet it now orbits is exhibiting unusual characteristics from when it was observed from 60 light years away at the start of their mission.
 
 Red streaks of unnatural growth paint the planet, a planet that was observed to be barren before they set off. Observations aside, the alien creatures conclude that this does not change the objective of their mission, it remains an unsuitable environment for their species in the long term and will require "The Change".
 
Departing in their pale ships, organic and seamless in shape, they land in several locations across the planets surface. Upon landing the entrances dissolve open and close to accommodate the aliens usage.

Stepping out of their vessels, the new alien creatures are long, humanoid, thin and with a pale off-white body that is accented in organic gold detail. A singular optical slit sits at "eye" level horizontally across their face. They communicate to each other through chittering and eye flashes that correspond with organic holographic displays that silhouette their head. Similar to the displays one would see from a bird of paradise from Earth. Two of these beings emerge from the vessel.

From a new opening in the vessel a golden, elongated diamond shaped spike emerges. A little larger in size than one of these beings, there is no clear sign of propulsion method as it floats in front of the two aliens. 

The spike buries itself into the ground, becoming translucent. Inside sits a nearly full term creature, another of the aliens, this one not yet coming to be. Embryotic wires dangle off of it, running to unseen mechanisms buried within the tip of the spike buried in the dirt.

Emanating from the center of the spike, white and gold organic fibers crawl across the ground. The fibers changing the composition of the ground around them, alien gases emerge from the chemistry at work. A chemistry which is growing further across the landscape. As the fibers spread out, the alien embryo housed inside dissolves into the wires, it's essence powering the process of change. 

The change spreads to the black and glowing crimson grass on the edge of a nearby tree line. In a fizzle of white dust which floats away into the air, the organics unique to this planet are disintegrated. The terraforming has begun.

 Beyond the tree line... a primeval scream, a scream which sounds more like a collection of creatures screaming in unison, their cries morphing between each other out of a singular source. 

A flock of black and glowing crimson creatures fly out of the trees and past the newcomers overhead.

Deep in the tree line towards a break in the foliage, light falls to the forest floor. What a moment ago had been empty besides a few blades of corrupted grass, now stands a dark figure. 

Perfectly still, piercing and warped, glowing crimson eyes watch the newcomers silently as the forest whispers around it.

In the sky, a cloud moves to cover the sun. A shadow casts across the landscape, gliding it's way to the tree line and further towards the clearing within. As shadow passes over the clearing the creature's figure appears to wipe away in a hard edge between the shadow and the exiting light. The shadow from above overtakes the landscape at an unnatural speed.

The closest newcomer looks up to observe the sudden cloud coverage, watching with unease. Behind it a light whisper is heard, again a sound not appearing to belong to a singular organism but a morph between several at a singular source. Looking behind, a faint crimson aura fades into the dirt. Leaving behind a dark silhouette that bares the shape of their counterpart. Quickly looking around, their partner is no where to be found. Fearful clicks and chittering emanate from the newcomer, warning displays at full mast around it's head. 

A loud crash from behind and the same primeval scream is heard again, this time seeming to come from the shadow coated landscape itself. Whipping it's head around, the newcomer observes in horror as it's vessel is split open by a bright crimson energy. Without strain, the vessel is shattered and sunken into the ground. Leaving behind the same fading aura and silhouette that was just observed a moment ago where the pieces fall. 

Silence takes over, not even wind falls across this land now. Shadow intensifies, there is nothing but stillness and the idle sound of the creatures "heart" beating. 

A few moments of stillness and shadow... it's not shadow though. A near perfect black that crawls across the newcomer...
  
Gnarled and clawed fingers erupt from the black around the creatures neck and pulls it back it's entire body swiftly into the dirt. This action once again only chimed by a light, corrupted whisper.
  
Stillness...
  
The shadow across the landscape shrinks to a single spot beside the planted golden spike which continues to dissolve the embryo within. From the spot of shadow the figure from the forest emerges out and up like being raised from a pool of non-reflective oil. The creature now stands silently and perceives the organism inside the spike. A few silent unmoving moments pass and the spike and organism dissolve into a glowing red dust which flows up into a black steam.
  
Elsewhere on the planet in a remote cave, a new shriek emanates.
