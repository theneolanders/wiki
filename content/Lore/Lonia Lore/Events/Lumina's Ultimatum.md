On the planet [[Vulpes]], a young Lumina sprinted through the candy store, her pockets bursting with stolen treats. As she reached for one last lollipop, two police officers barged in, giving chase. Heart racing, Lumina ducked into a narrow alleyway. But her haste betrayed herâ€”her foot caught on a loose brick and she tumbled to the ground. The officers' heavy footsteps grew louder as they approached. Suddenly, a dark shadow fell across Lumina. Ninko materialized before her, transforming from a menacing, eldritch silhouette into an elegant woman clad in a traditional kimono. Swiftly, she draped her sleeves over the fallen thief just as the police rushed by the alley entrance. Lumina lay hidden beneath Ninko's garments, confused and breathless, as the officers' voices faded away. Slowly, Ninko lifted her sleeve, revealing Lumina to her mysterious savior. She smiled enigmatically before plucking a lollipop from Lumina's collection and unwrapping it with a flourish. Ninko pointed at Lumina's right eye, then hesitated- as if reconsidering. But in an instant, her hand transformed into a set of razor-sharp claws. With one brutal motion, she plunged her fingers into Lumina's socket, tearing out the thief's eye. Lumina wailed in agony as darkness enveloped her vision.

After a few minutes, she finally opened her good eye, having clenched it shut from the pain. But now, she was left with a void on the other side; a hole in her body and soul which could never mend.
