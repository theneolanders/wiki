The origin planet of [[Ninko]]'s species.

Remina is an alien planet within our solar system, it has bunch of deep waters that vary in different colors and high mountains. It's atmosphere is a pleasant warm summer weather all year around, the planet however lacks breathable oxygen which makes it unhabitable for humans and most plants, instead the planet has its own ecosystem entirely. 

The planet is also a home to blue raspberries that grow deep in the underwater caves, they have healing properties tied to them.  
When growing off the cane, the 'raspberry' is concealed inside a protective gel covering- almost like a frog egg, intended to defend the berries from being eaten before they are ready to fall.
