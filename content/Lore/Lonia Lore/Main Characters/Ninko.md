Species: "[[K'uminhyō]]"
---

A member of the [[K'uminhyō]] species with an all-encompassing dominion over light. The primary form she takes is of a pink nine-tailed kitsune, although she has many other forms. Because of the nature of her abilities, she has a cruel fascination with human eyes due to their light-collecting nature. This fascination has led her to taking the eyes of humans that she finds alluring as trophies and turning them into crystalline wind chimes within her temple on [[Remina]]. 

Long ago, Ninko resided primarily in Japan, and as such was worshipped as a Kami. Offerings of fresh bodies would be made and she would take their eyes and livers in exchange for the total protection of the area around Mt. Hōei.

[[Lumina Valo|Lumina]] is her chosen avatar, acting as a vessel for her light powers- in exchange for an eye that Ninko found particularly beautiful. This beauty Ninko saw was due to their unique color, a deep green very uncommon for humans from [[Vulpes]]. However, this exchange was not as smooth as Lumina expected it would be- not only would the gaping wound it left not heal, but as time continued it became clearer and clearer her entire body was now [[Celestial Witch|cursed]].
