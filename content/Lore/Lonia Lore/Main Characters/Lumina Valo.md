Originally born as a human on the planet Vulpes, her life changed when she met the alien kitsune [[Ninko]]. In exchange for her powers Ninko took Lumina's right eye as a trophy, transforming her into a [[Celestial Witch]]. As a result of Ninko's 'gift', Lumina's body was no longer that of a human. Instead, she became a being made from solidified, magical light.

#### Personality
Lumina is a risk taker, often gambling with her life for the possibility of reward. In conversation, she is highly talkative and will often make witty remarks at others' expense. She has a hard time staying still, always requiring physical or mental stimulation to keep herself engaged. Her demeanor can come off as deranged if not straight up psychotic at times; this is the result of her being unable to take life seriously after receiving her powers. She is a wildcard and would rather do things on impulse than on command.
