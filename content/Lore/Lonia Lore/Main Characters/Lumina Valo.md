#### Personality
Lumina is a risk taker, often gambling with her life for the possibility of reward. In conversation, she is highly talkative and will often make witty remarks at others' expense. She has a hard time staying still, always requiring physical or mental stimulation to keep herself engaged. 

Her often bombastic approach can make her attempts at sneaking around not go as planned. Her demeanor can come off as deranged if not straight up psychotic at times; this is the result of her being unable to take life seriously after receiving her powers.

#### Life on Vulpes
WIP.

#### Appearance
Ninko being a light [[K'uminhy≈ç]] transformed Lumina from a human into a being made from solidified, magical light.

She has fuchsia and violet hair, with the fuchsia hair covering most of her head, including long split bangs, and the violet hair tied up into two drill-shaped curls. She has dark teal freckles, her tongue and insides are teal while her teeth are white and sharp like a sharks.

A glowing halo hangs above her head and a pair of glowing wings floats behind her. She wears an eyepatch with a purple and pink flower to cover her missing right eye. 
Around her neck, she wears a glowing cross necklace. She wears a black off-the-shoulder shirt with purple shoulder straps. The shirt has a white cross across the front of her chest. On her arms, she wears fingerless gloves that go above her elbow, with belts strapping it down to her arm. Her nails glow in the dark. She wears a short purple skirt with a belt around it. On her left leg, she has two belts that wrap around her thigh. She wears knee-high stockings with two white stripes at the top. She wears tall, purple, pirate-inspired boots with two buckles. 

#### Abilities
As the chosen avatar of [[Ninko]], Lumina has been bestowed Ninko's unique dominion over visible light. Clever usage of this power enables her to perform many feats that may not be immediately obvious. This includes, but is not limited to:  
- Flight and super speed
- Illusions and invisibility (she often uses this to conceal her body parts, primarily her wings and halo)
- Conjuring objects from hard light (like her gun)
- Light-based attacks (lasers, flashes, slashes, and waves)
