In the terrifying horror film Lucidity, audiences were introduced to the nightmarish presence of a demonic killer clown referred to as ‘Blueberry’. This sinister entity manipulated his victims through a potent sleeping pill, masquerading as a melatonin supplement and widely available in stores. The drug caused its unwitting consumers to experience paralysis within days, leaving them vulnerable.

Blueberry, a demonic entity who earned his name from the pills tasting like blueberries, doesn't react to pain and rarely speaks as he tortures his victims, who cannot distinguish dream from reality. As their physical bodies decay, unable to consume sustenance, victims remain eternally trapped in gore-filled nightmares, reliving their gruesome deaths repeatedly.
