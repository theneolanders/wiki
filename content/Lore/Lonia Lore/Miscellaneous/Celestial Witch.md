Celestial witches are the chosen avatars of the [[K'uminhyō]]. When chosen by a member of the K'uminhyō, they take on a form which can harvest energy from [[Underspace]] that the K'uminhyō siphon may off in order to prolong their life. In return for being a sort of generator, they are gifted with abilities depending on the type of K'uminhyō they are.
