An ancient race of shapeshifting deities born on the planet [[Remina]]. When not in any other form, they take the form of a nine-tailed kitsune. Although they naturally lead long lives compared to humans, they will often pick an avatar known as a [[Celestial Witch]] to gift their abilities to. This is in order to prolong them even further by using their avatar as a conduit to pull energy from [[Underspace.]]
