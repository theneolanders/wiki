#### Personality
Lumina is a risk taker, often gambling with her life for the possibility of reward. In conversation, she is highly talkative and will often make witty remarks at others' expense. She has a hard time staying still, always requiring physical or mental stimulation to keep herself engaged.

After being cured of her transformation into [[Caligo]], her demeanor rapidly shifted overnight. She closed herself off from everything, vowing to never allow herself to be hurt again. This especially manifested as a compulsion to be insulated from the outside world, believing that covering herself up fully was the only way to be safe. Now plagued by anxiety, her extroversion and risk taking behaviors are now a thing of the past.

#### Appearance
Currently, Lumina has had two distinct appearances.
 
Originally, she has fuchsia and violet hair, with the fuchsia hair covering most of her head, including long split bangs, and the violet hair tied up into two drill-shaped curls. A glowing halo hung above her head and a pair of glowing wings floated behind her. She wore an eyepatch with a purple and pink flower to cover her missing right eye. 
Around her neck, she wore a glowing cross necklace. She wore a black off-the-shoulder shirt with purple shoulder straps. The shirt had a white cross across the front of her chest. On her arms, she wore fingerless gloves that went above her elbow, with belts strapping it down to her arm. Her nails glowed in the dark. She wore a short purple skirt with a belt around it. On her left leg, she had two belts that wrapped around her thigh. She wore knee-high stockings with two white stripes at the top. She wore tall, purple, pirate-inspired boots with two buckles. 

Currently, she wears her hair mostly the same, with thicker bangs to cover her ears. She still has the same halo and wings. Everything else, though, is entirely different. Her hair is tied up using a pair of glowing crosses. On her face is a mask inspired by a plague doctor, crafted from gray leather and stitched together with black thread. Goggles cover the eyes of the mask, with glowing rings on their edge and black lenses. Deeply set inside the goggles are a pair of glowing eyes. Covering the rest of her body below the chin is a black latex bodysuit, fully insulating her body from the elements. A glowing cross floats in front of her neck. She wears an open purple leather jacket, with a glowing lining. A belt is tightly wrapped around the chest, with a buckle on each side. She also has belts on her upper arms, above where the jacket ends. On her hands, she wears a pair of thick, purple leather gloves with a glowing cross on the top of the forearm and belts around her wrists. She wears a corset made from 3 belts, with the buckles neatly stacked on top of one another. She wears a long, purple pleated skirt with a glowing waistband. She wears a similar pair of pirate-style boots, but they are taller and have three belts instead of two.

#### Abilities
As the chosen avatar of [[Ninko]], Lumina has been bestowed Ninko's unique dominion over visible light. Clever usage of this power enables her to perform many feats that may not be immediately obvious. This includes, but is not limited to:  
- Flight and super speed
- Illusions and invisibility
- Conjuring objects from hard light
- Light-based attacks (lasers, flashes, slashes, and waves)
