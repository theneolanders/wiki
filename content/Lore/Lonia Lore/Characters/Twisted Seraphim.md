The **Twisted Seraphim** is a criminal organization wholly focused on profiting from large-scale thefts. It is made up of five members: four are heavily augmented women from [[The Secondary Timeline|the secondary timeline]], and the fifth is [[Lumina]], their former leader, who is currently estranged from the group.
This shakeup was caused by her unwilling recruitment by [[Tavish Augmetitech]].

## Active Members
### Alcea
The former leader of the group before Lumina was taken in. After Lumina's departure, she returned to that position.
##### Personality
Highly ambitious, she aims to dominate every situation she finds herself in. Although she appears apathetic on the surface, she is highly motivated by aggression, materialism, and megalomania. She believes that she must always come first, even to the detriment of her own gang. 
##### Appearance
Alcea has curly fire-engine red hair, with a black tiara atop her head. Beyond the tiara, her hair is tied into a large bun- giving the appearance of a full crown. Her hair also has a cowlick on each side of her head that look like horns. Her eyes' irises are gold with spirals imprinted onto them, and their sclera are black. Her skin appears to be bronzed, and she has multiple tattoos. One of them is visible on her left arm- a snake wrapped around its length from her shoulder to her wrist. She wears a white bell-bottomed jumpsuit with no sleeves, with slits placed near the calves for flexibility, and two belts around her hips. The jumpsuit exposes her back, revealing a much larger yakuza-style tattoo of a snake wrapped around a dagger with roses around it. She wears a skull necklace and a metal V-shaped choker. She wears silver high-heels with two straps and ruby soles. Her hands have been extensively modified- with metal claws and protective jewelry implanted directly into them. She also wears many of the stolen rings she has collected.
##### Powers
As the only true [[Psionics|psionic]] of the group, she has the ability to manipulate the blood within people's bodies, including her own. Because of this ability, she rarely uses weapons, instead resorting to melee when necessary.
### Leia
As a one-woman wrecking crew, she often forges a path for the others- often in a very chaotic fashion. 
##### Personality
Mischievous, condescending and laid-back overall, Leia does things only if she feels like it. At times, she becomes overly energetic with no rhyme or reason. She has little regard for others' wishes and will violate their privacy as she pleases.
##### Appearance
Leia has striped black and yellow ribbon cables for hair that are tied into a odango style. On both buns, a hazard sign is used as a hairclip, and three long ribbon cables reach down to her upper arms. The right side of her head is covered in barricade tape, used as a sort of bandage. All over her body, she is wrapped in barricade tape in an attempt to cover up the most dire wounds.  Her left eye is fully orange, with a spiral imprinted onto it that covers its entire surface. Above and below the left eye, a black scar stretches from her brow to the edge of her mouth. She also has golden shark teeth. Her skin is ice-blue, and the scars on its surface reveals the inner structure of her bionics. She wears a black and yellow leotard with a clear poncho covering her shoulders. Below the poncho, her back is exposed, revealing a rat's nest of damaged cables. She has two gold belts around her waist and hips. She wears knee-high boots with rings used to fasten them onto her legs. The soles of the boots are orange. 
##### Powers
Uses implants originally intended for construction workers, now repurposed for their absurd toughness. Her left arm can transform into multiple different tools, but the one she uses most commonly is a massive spiral drill for hard surfaces. Her boots are fitted with rockets, allowing her to fly and dive absurdly quickly.
### Lily
Works double-duty for the gang, assembling explosives and maintaining their weapons in her free time. 
##### Personality
Her exposure to the chemicals she breathes has made her disposition rather deranged. It is due in part to this that she commonly underestimates the strength of her abilities, causing significantly more damage than planned. Outside of work, she is playful and often teases the other members- although she does care about them, especially doing her best to serve Alcea.
##### Appearance
Lily has light-purple hair with red tips. She wears a pair of protective goggles on her forehead with green lenses. Her skin is tea green, and her eyes have black sclera with blue diamond-shaped irises. A large respirator is permanently affixed to her face. Her neck and lower torso have been heavily armored to protect her toxin immunity system. She wears a specially-cut shirt with shoulder straps with "TOXIC" written on them, meant to accommodate her implants. She has black rubber gloves with green biohazard symbols, fastening belts, palms, and finger pads. Below her torso armor, she has a thick belt with many buttons- to hold up a large pair of black shorts with green Xs on each leg. The shorts have many buttoned pockets for the sake of storage. The shorts are taped down to her legs to ensure they do not get caught on anything. She wears a pair of white platform boots with a toxic liquid visible inside the soles.
##### Powers
Uses her expertise to create explosives and chemical weapons used in the gang's schemes. Her body has been modified to be immune to the toxins she uses in her weaponry- to the point that she breathes toxic gas through her rebreather instead of air. 
### Violet 
Analytical and level headed, she handles planning the heists; while breaking into digital networks to make sure things go exactly as she planned.
##### Personality
As the most composed member of the gang, she often finds how the others work somewhat frustrating. This is primarily due to a difference in morals- she avoids violence wherever she can. But even despite that conflict of interest, she knows leaving the gang would only make things end worse.
##### Appearance
Violet has long deep blue hair with bangs, and her skin is fully white. In her hair, she has two pairs of earphones that are directly implanted into her head. Her right eye is similar to the other members' eyes, having a black sclera and a blue iris. But her left eye is wholly different, replaced with a device sporting multiple types of cameras and a bright pink indicator light in the center. The rest of her face is covered by a black neck gaiter with the Twisted Seraphim logo. The gaiter seamlessly flows into a cropped long-sleeve shirt with a two-triangle logo on the left shoulder. On the forearms of the shirt, she has two bracers studded with buttons and hologram projectors. Below the shirt, she wears a clear blue plastic dress with two white belts around her chest and hips. Underneath that, she wears a white leotard as a base layer. She wears gray leggings with black knee-high socks on top. She wears white high-heels with sharp tips and power-button logos at the front of the ankle.
##### Powers
Often operating from a distance, she uses her skills to infiltrate the networks of her targets and make things simpler for the gang. When she is operating in the field, she has a variety of tools at her disposal contained within the bracers on her arms. The main ones of note are holographic projectors for displaying digital information, tools to break into systems, and cables for connecting to them.
