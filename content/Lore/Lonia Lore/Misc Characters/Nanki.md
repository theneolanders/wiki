A member of the [[K'uminhy≈ç]] species with an all-encompassing dominion over shadows.
The most common form he takes is a dark blue kitsune, almost resembling a bat with glowing red eyes. He always makes sure his avatars don't make any form of sound, so he takes their voices when they form a pact with him.
