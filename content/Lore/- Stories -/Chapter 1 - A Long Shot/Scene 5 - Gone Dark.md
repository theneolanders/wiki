I don't know how long it's been.

I don't even have access to my internal clock. I'm shut out of everything. This goes beyond even being trapped in my own body, I'm trapped in my *mind*.

Why would anyone have done this? We have checks in place. There are errors that are supposed to be thrown, warnings to acknowledge, protocols to be trained on. The only way this could have happened is by a malicious actor.

But... again... Why? What did I do? This whole thing, Project Intergalactic, the Homesteader, the Rustybot chassis, it's all for humanity's progression. What reason is there to halt that?

And *how*? We have methods to prevent this sort of-

I'm thinking in circles. Is this what it feels like to go crazy? A few weeks of sensory deprivation and I lose it just like that?

I have no sight. I have no sound. I have no motor functions, diagnostics, notifications, or pressure sensors. I have my thoughts and I have the passage of time.

...

There has to be *something* I can do. I designed half the systems in this project anyway. Whoever did this, cunning as they must be, can't be perfect.

I'm still aware of myself, for one. The perpetrator likely assumed I went into stasis for the journey, not realizing how much I hate being unaware of my surroundings.

Or maybe they did know that. What if they knew I'd be in here and that I'd be panicking, frantic to try and escape the prison they designed for me. It's the perfect way to ensure that even if I do get free, I'll be too stir crazy to be taken seriously.

No, I'm losing track of what's probable. I can feel the fear getting to me. It's really uncomfortable in here...

Ok, focus. How do I get myself to boot up? Firstly, I need to know why the boot is failing. There are a few options. Maybe the transfer wasn't as smooth as it should have been and everything got destroyed except my drive. Already thought of that, in which case there's not much I can do.

Alright, next: There's some protocol in place preventing me from sending my boot signal. If this is the case, there are a few things I can try. Every drive port has monitoring protocols to prevent this exact situation from happening. All I have to do is manually trigger one of those and I'm home free.

Easier said than done, perhaps. Still possible though. If this was an intentional trap as I suspect, it must have been done with some confidence of keeping me contained.

We'll see about that. Clearly whoever this is has underestimated my mental fortitude. They think by sealing me in digitized nothingness I'll just roll over and cease to be a problem?

That's almost funny.
