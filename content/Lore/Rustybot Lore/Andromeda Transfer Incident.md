The Andromeda Transfer Incident occurred in February of 217i where Toby Tsur's Small Step project tragically failed.

After successful return signals of intergalactic probes sent to Andromeda via [[Faster Than Light Technology|Warp Drives]], [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot|Toby Tsur]] confined his consciousness to the first [[Rusty Manufacturing#Drones|Rusty Drone]] and was transported to the distant star system of [[Quindol System|Quindol]] using [[Faster Than Light Technology|Induced Quantum Tunneling]] as both a publicity stunt for the [[Flow]] corporation and proof of concept for intergalactic travel.

If all went according to plan, Toby would make planetfall in the drone and set up a small receiver so that Earth would be able to send additional parts to him. He would then begin overseeing building the infrastructure for an IQT Anchor travel hub.

Unfortunately, the activation protocol did not proceed as intended. Rather than booting once in orbit, Toby was locked into a state of total sensory deprivation for multiple months.

# Post-Incident

Due to Earth's reliance on Flow for employment, component production, raw material transport, and the upkeep of the [[Rusty Manufacturing#The Datanet|The Datanet]], the incident caused a socioeconomic collapse of an unprecedented scale.
