An early version of [[Dataspace]], The Datanet is a now-defunct extension of the internet using breakthrough [[Faster Than Light Technology]]. 

[[Rusty Manufacturing]] (RM) developed the Datanet for the betterment of humanity, and user's enjoyed open access to it's services for no cost. This led to mass adoption of the system, to the point of nearly two thirds of earth's information traffic being routed through RM servers.

As a result of the [[Andromeda Transfer Incident]], the Datanet would be shut down, causing mass collapse of digital infrastructure known as [[The Rusty Exodus]].
