Each timeline in [[The Multiverse]] is equally as real as any other, making a designation such as "primary" somewhat of a misnomer. The Primary Timeline is defined by [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot|Rustybot]] and [[Memento]] as their universe of origin for the sake of subjectively cataloging the multiverse. It is also sometimes referred to as The Primeline.

This timeline is unique in that it has a nearly non-permeable [[The Multiverse#Universal Membranes|lower membrane]], meaning there is almost no natural influence from [[Underspace]]. Practically speaking, the only forces present are the baseline physical laws by which every known universe is governed. The Primeline therefore is no different from [[Lore Information|our own universe]] until the year 2046, when it [[The Multiverse#Divergence|diverges]].

## History

Humans in the primary timeline followed a course identical to real-life humanity until the year 2046, when a major breakthrough in statistical learning models results in the formation of the first general artificial intelligence.
#### True AI
Digital life in the Primeline was conceptualized as early as the 1900s, and the first truly sapient AI came into existence in the year 2046 following advances in recursive statistical models and human brain mapping. This development led to an explosion in funding for digital consciousness research that resulted in nearly two million digital minds created by the year 2055.

Digital consciousnesses initially saw resistance to being recognized by society at large, especially in The United States and Middle Asia. The first country to legally recognize digital citizens was South Africa in 2059. Immediately following this step, the South African economy saw a massive growth period as digital people flocked to the nation.

Humanity saw a worldwide acceleration in the field of robotics technology as desire for a sustainable physical body was expressed by those without one. 
#### The North American Collapse
The North American collapse encompasses a period of time where The United States, Canada, and to a lesser extent Mexico, saw economic downfall due to civil unrest and a stagnation of government. Though the exact start and end of the collapse is heavily debated, most agree that it can be broadly assigned to the 2070s.
