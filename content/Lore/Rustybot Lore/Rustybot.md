Born as a biological human in the year 2135, Toby Tsur was the son of [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot#Rodney Tsur|Rodney Tsur]] and [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot#Melody Tsur|Melody Tsur]]. He was fascinated with space travel, robotics, and automation from a very young age. This lead him to become increasingly cybernetic until the age of 25, when he underwent a final procedure to become fully mechanical.

Toby excelled in his schooling, graduating all mandatory learning initiatives by the age of 16 before spending the rest of his adolescence and early adulthood working for [[Flow]].

Toby would eventually take on his chosen name, Rustybot, following the [[Andromeda Transfer Incident]].

# Personality
Toby Tsur was known for being an extremely driven individual. He was described as being "happy to speak with me but clearly anxious to get back to work" by an interviewer shortly after Rusty Manufacturing's announcement of the [[Quindol System|Quindol]] expedition. An extremely intelligent scientist with PHDs in numerous technological fields, Toby strongly believed that constant improvement was his life's purpose. Even as the CEO of one of the most successful companies in history he only paid himself enough to get by, devoting the rest of Rusty Manufacturing's funds and his own time to developments that would benefit humanity as a whole.

In stark contrast to his previous self, Rustybot's most notable character trait is his ego. The Andromeda Incident shattered his trust in humanity. Not just in the moral nature of people but in their competence. As such, he begins to believe himself to be the only individual in the universe capable of driving scientific progress. This shift in outlook causes his natural propensity for problem solving to refocus. With securing humanity's future no longer a personal priority, he instead does everything in his power to secure his own at all costs. As opposed to his life on Earth where he had a constant stream of issues to resolve or improve and barely enough time to tackle all of it, he now finds himself isolated and without a schedule.

Rustybot develops an abundance of weaponry and defense technology during his isolation despite coming across no external threatening presences in his new home galaxy. His desire to protect himself and fear of being hurt again cause an overwhelming urge to expand his industry at an exponential rate. In a sense, the constant increase in manufacturing potential of Rusty Manufacturing is Rustybot attempting to satiate his newfound paranoia.

Over the course of the Ringleaders story, Rustybot is forced to reconsider how he handles diplomatic relations with both Earth and the other members of the council. Meeting [[Memento]] is the first time in many years where he can't simply ignore or destroy a perceived problem. When the two of them eventually build [[The Ring]], he is only playing along to agther intel, but is soon presented with evidence that other beings are entirely capable of being intelligent and useful.

Though he is initially snarky and dismissive of the other members, Rustybot's demeanor softens significantly as The Ringleaders become less of an obligation and more of a found family to him. The Swarm is especially critical in this journey with their precise pokes and prods regarding Rusty's behaviour. Despite his repeated outbursts when his own faults are brought to light, his natural desire to analyze every situation down to the last detail does cause Rusty to consider what his actions look like from the outside and eventually make positive change.
