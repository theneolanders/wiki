A Drone is any [[Rusty Manufacturing]] unit capable of being controlled by [[Pilots]]. 

Drones range from Alpha Drones to [[Bitbots]] and can have a wide array in functionality, but are primarily used for the automation of manual labor.

Alpha Drones are equipped with multiple [[The Multiverse|Underspace]] Harvester Cores, [[Microfabricators]], and countless weapon systems. These drones are capable of self repair and indefinite uptime. Pilots in these units usually lead exploration missions and expansion initiatives.

> [!NOTE] The Prime Unit
> While a Prime Unit is often referred to as a separate type of drone, this distinction is only a form of utility to denote which Alpha Drone is currently being inhabited by [[Rustybot]].

Beta Drones are often assigned to an individual production facility. They have limited combat capabilities but extensive sensor suites.

Gamma Drones are universal manual labor machines. Not much more than a hull and motors. Often a few dozen exist under each Beta.

A Bitbot is a simple drone that performs maintenance, repairs, and cleaning. They often act as autonomous power tools or surveillance units.
