Deep in the greatest voids of the universe lies a fortress containing the unbroken consciousness stream of [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot|Rustybot]]. Protected by the pinnacle of [[Rusty Manufacturing]]'s defensive technology, this vigilant bastion of central intelligence is the last line of defense against potential threats before all is lost. Whether out of fear or practical caution - though likely a mix of both - Rustybot has hidden the computational hardware that runs his own mind behind hundreds of failsafe measures and obscured the location to the best of his abilities.

Rustybot accesses all Rusty Manufacturing hardware through a [[Faster Than Light Technology#Quantum Entangled Communication|QEC]] connection to [[Rusty Manufacturing#Dataspace|Dataspace]]. As such, the destruction of any [[Rusty Manufacturing#Drones|drones]] he pilots poses no threat to his actual safety.
