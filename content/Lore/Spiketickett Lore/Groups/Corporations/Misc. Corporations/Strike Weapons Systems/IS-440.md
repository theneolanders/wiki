Taking many cues from designs made over 250 years prior, they designed a capable service weapon with reliability in inhospitable environments as one of its core design principles. It has a 40 round capacity owing to its unique magazine, which sits flush with the frame of the firearm. It fires 10.9mm-diameter (.44") [[Pulse ammunition]] rounds out of a comparatively long barrel for its size, due to its bullpup configuration.
