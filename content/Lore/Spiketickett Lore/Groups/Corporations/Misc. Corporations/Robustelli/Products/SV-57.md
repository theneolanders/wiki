>An anti-materiel rifle - in your pocket

A magnum-caliber handgun designed by [[Robustelli]] which uses linear Gauss-rails integrated into the frame; used to simulate the effect of a rifled barrel in propellant-based firearms. 
Despite the appearance of having a snub nose barrel, the Gauss rails continue to propel the projectile using electromagnetic fields even after exiting the barrel. It fires .577" [[Gauss ammunition|Gauss slugs]] from an 8-round box magazine.

Originally designed to handle the likes of the megafauna found on distant planets, it now finds far more use against inorganic and Augmented threats by civilians and paramilitary forces alike.

The 'SV' is Italian for Superveloce, meaning "superfast", and is the standard naming convention among all of [[Robustelli]]'s gauss weapon offerings.
## Variants
The SV-57 has a vast amount of options- from different finishes to major alterations to the function of the weapon.
#### Tavish Standard
This package, designed specially for the [[Tavish Augmetitech Self-Defense Force|TASDF]], matches Tavish Augmetitech's corporate colors, and comes with a uniquely-colored polycarbonate grip.
It also comes standard with a smart-link directly configured for Tavish-issued hardware and a visible-spectrum laser.
#### SVI-57
The I in 'SVI' stands for "Intelligenza", and represents its improved capability over the base Superveloce - a hardware package that allows the linear Gauss-rails to be tuned further; meaning bullets can alter course mid-flight based on user input.
