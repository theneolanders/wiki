An evolution of [[Robustelli|Robustelli's]] sporting shotguns, upgraded with the technology of the future. This shotgun takes the same 23x75mmR pulse shells as similar offerings from [[Apex Arms]], however it uses them to greater effect by magnetically aligning and accelerating the pellets down the barrel, like their other [[Gauss weapons|gauss guns]].
Although it's been debated whether this technology is truly necessary for what is already a potent cartridge, Robustelli claims it is perfectly in line with their heritage of precision weapons.

The 'ND' is Italian for "Nuvola d'acciaio", meaning "cloud of steel", a name which Robustelli shotguns had maintained for nearly 700 years by the time of this model's release. The ND-68 was a particularly controversial upgrade as it marked the transition to the hybrid [[Gauss weapons|gauss]]-[[Pulse weapons|pulse]] design the newer ND models are known for. Before that point, the line was entirely either traditional 12-gauge, or later 23mm, shotguns with no electronic components. To appeal to the purists who opposed the newer style, Robustelli produced the SV-69, a final traditional design that continues to be produced to this day in smaller numbers.
