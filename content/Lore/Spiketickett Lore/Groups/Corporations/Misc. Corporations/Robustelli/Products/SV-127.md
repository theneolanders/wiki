>An anti-materiel rifle - in your pocket

A magnum-caliber handgun designed by [[Robustelli]] which uses linear Gauss-rails integrated into the frame; used to simulate the effect of a rifled barrel in propellant-based firearms. 
Despite the appearance of having a snub nose barrel, the Gauss rails continue to propel the projectile using electromagnetic fields even after exiting the barrel. It fires 12.7mm [[Gauss weapons|Gauss slugs]] from an 9-round box magazine.

Originally designed to handle the likes of the megafauna found on distant planets, it now finds far more use against inorganic and Augmented threats by civilians and paramilitary forces alike.

The 'SV' is Italian for Superveloce, meaning "superfast", and is the standard naming convention for [[Robustelli]]'s gauss pistol lineage. The SV 127 is a successor to the SV 109, which fired .429" rounds and was considered the black sheep of the product line- it did not have the signature reliability of a Robustelli and its styling was a significant departure from previous models as well. The 127, meanwhile, has been considered a major return to form for the SV series.

## Variants
The SV-127 has a vast amount of options- from different finishes to major alterations to the function of the weapon.
#### Tavish Standard
This package, designed specially for the [[Tavish Augmetitech Self-Defense Force|TASDF]], matches Tavish Augmetitech's corporate colors, and comes with a uniquely-colored polycarbonate grip.
It also comes standard with a smart-link directly configured for Tavish-issued hardware and a visible-spectrum laser.
#### SVI-127
The I in 'SVI' stands for "Intelligenza", and represents its improved capability over the base Superveloce - a hardware package that allows the linear Gauss-rails to be tuned further; meaning bullets can alter course mid-flight based on user input.
