Jacketed in steel, with a depleted uranium core, these extra-dense, cylindrical projectiles wreak havoc upon anything unfortunate enough to be in the way, flesh or metal. The cartridge is rapidly spun in the chamber, a small explosive "kicker" charge is activated to begin the launch, and then the round is electromagnetically accelerated to full speed in the barrel of the firearm. Stabilized in flight with fins integrated into the core of the projectile, Gauss rounds have effective ranges much further than other firearms technologies.
