The role of a sapper in the 27th century is only partially removed from the original meaning, that being of a combat engineer who destroyed enemy fortifications. In the last few centuries, the role of a sapper became that of a saboteur- however they don heavily advanced spacesuits and target enemy starships, using [[High-frequency blade|high-frequency blades]] and explosives to carve apart their hulls and destroy vital infrastructure. In recent times, sappers have become far less common due to the proliferation of [[Faster Than Light Technology|faster than light tech]], but they still may target slower vessels. Despite this, the advanced gear still finds use to this day because weapons and armor of that quality are still hard to come by.
