[[- User Manual Info -]]

- Default suit size is too small
- New busters are positioned wrong in suit mode
- Suit mode is just broken in general, likely will be removed soon
- Non-trusted pilots can't open their own chest compartment
- The chest compartment can't be opened while shutdown, preventing the power core from being reinserted in case of energy loss
- Leg raycasts don't account for user scale
- Bitbot doesn't disappear quickly enough during rocket/bike/compact mode transformations
- Dequipping suit mode doesn't reset hands
- Recall lasers still appear when there's no part to recall, then get stuck until a successful attempt is made
- Bitbot can be thrown into camera mode even when being dropped onto the shoulder snapper

#### Sequence breaks
