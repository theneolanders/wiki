# Contributing with Obsidian
## 1. Making a fork (optional)
Forks allow us to easily prevent multiple people's edits overlapping.

## 2. Setting up Github Desktop
Github Desktop will allow you to push and pull without needing to use the command line interface.

- Step 1) Install [Github Desktop App ](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Step 2) Open the [Github repo](https://github.com/theneolanders/neolanders-wiki)
- Step 3) Click "Open with Github Desktop"
